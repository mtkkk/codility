Big O Notation Cheat Sheet

(GOOD ALGORITHMS)
---------------------
O(1) 			- Constant time, fixed number of operations (result = n * n)
O(log n)		- Logarithmic time, the value of n is halved on each iteration of the loop
O(n)			- Linear time (For loop iterating trough the array)
O(n log n)		- 
---------------------
(BAD ALGORITHMS)
O(n^k), k >= 2	-		
O(k^n), k >= 2	-
O(n!)			-


Codility expected time complexity 

n <= 1.000.000, the expected time complexity is O(n) or O(n log n),
n <= 10.000, the expected time complexity is O(n2),
n <= 500, the expected time complexity is O(n3).
